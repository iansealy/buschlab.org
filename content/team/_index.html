    <p>Elisabeth is Associate Principal Investigator in the <a href="https://www.med.cam.ac.uk/">Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge</a>. After studying Biochemistry at the <a href="https://uni-tuebingen.de/">Eberhard Karls University</a> in Tübingen Elisabeth did her PhD at the <a href="http://eb.mpg.de/">Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology</a>. There she participated in one of the large-scale forward genetic screens in zebrafish. In 2003 Elisabeth joined Derek Stemple’s group at the <a href="https://www.sanger.ac.uk/">Wellcome Sanger Institute</a> to study a group of motility mutants from the Tübingen screen. In 2005 she became project leader in the <a href="https://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/zebrafish/zmp/">Zebrafish Mutation Project</a> where she developed high-throughput approaches to tie morphological and molecular phenotypes to the mutations identified by exome sequencing.</p>

    <h2>Ian Sealy</h2>
    <img src="ian.jpg" alt="Ian Sealy" />
    <div><a href="mailto:ian@buschlab.org">ian@buschlab.org</a></div>
    <p>Ian is a bioinformatician in the Busch Lab and has a PhD in molecular biology from the University of Bristol.</p>
    <p>He worked for seven years as a full stack web developer at the <a href="http://www.bris.ac.uk/ilrt/aboutus/">Institute for Learning &amp; Research Technology</a>, specialising in producing accessible and usable web applications with open source tools. He also worked for three years as Head of Technology at <a href="https://www.thelocal.com/">The Local</a>, a European news organisation which, at the time he left, received over 3 million visitors and 25 million page views per month. Ian also worked for 20 years as a sessional lecturer at Birkbeck, University of London, where he taught a part-time Postgraduate Certificate in Web Design and Development.</p>
    <p>Ian joined the <a href="https://www.sanger.ac.uk/">Wellcome Sanger Institute</a> in 2004 to work on a number of projects related to the sequencing, assembly, annotation and mutagenesis of the zebrafish genome, including <a href="http://www.zf-health.org/zf-models/">ZF-MODELS</a> and <a href="http://www.ensembl.org/">Ensembl</a>. In 2010 he joined the <a href="https://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/zebrafish/zmp/">Zebrafish Mutation Project</a> and since then has worked on a range of projects, most of which are linked by their use of next-generation sequencing to analyse vertebrate gene expression.</p>

    <h2>Richard White</h2>
    <img src="rich.jpg" alt="Richard White" />
    <div><a href="mailto:rich@buschlab.org">rich@buschlab.org</a></div>
    <p>Richard is a bioinformatician in the Busch Lab and has a PhD in developmental biology from the University of London.</p>
    <p>He then did a postdoc for five years at the University of California, Irvine in the lab of <a href="https://tschilling.bio.uci.edu/">Tom Schilling</a>, working on retinoic acid (RA) signalling in early anterior-posterior patterning. The project focused on how degradation of RA by CYP26 enzymes affects the dynamics and robustness of RA signalling and involved a collaboration to build a mathematical model of the RA gradient.</p>
    <p>Richard joined Derek Stemple's lab at the <a href="https://www.sanger.ac.uk/">Wellcome Sanger Institute</a> in 2007 to work on a project to try and infer gene regulatory relationships from gene expression data coupled with gene perturbations. In 2011, he made the switch from wet lab to bioinformatics and joined the <a href="https://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/zebrafish/zmp/">Zebrafish Mutation Project</a> to do variant calling from exome sequencing in order to identify mutants. Since then, Richard has worked on software to automate CRISPR/Cas9 experiments (guide RNA design and amplicon screening for variant identification) and large scale RNA-seq studies on early zebrafish and mouse development.</p>
